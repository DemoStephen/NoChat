# NoChat
A real-time web chat application as my specialization portfolio project
(This is a work in progress...)

- To be built with node.js for backend
- Mongo for handling database of userdata
- Redis for handling user sessions and real-time message data
- Express to handle routing and middleware support
- Using ngrok to expose the local express server to the internet without messing without messing with any extra settings.

  Access with: https://lucky-pig-touching.ngrok-free.app
